This document describes how to define your own Metadata schemas, which can be published in the Data Discovery Engine.

### How to define a metadata schema?

 * Why should we define our schemas in a standardized way?
 
   - To better share schemas
     
     Any application involves particular data types will most likely need to define your own data schema. Unless you expect to keep your data structure hidden from your users (either general users or developer users), it's always a good practice to share your data schema with your users. Often we see three scenarios below.
     
     |    |                           |     |
     | -- | ------------------------- | --- |
     | #1 | Not sharing schema at all | ❌ |
     | #2 | Sharing schema in a non-computable form (e.g. word, pdf, html files) | ❌ |
     | #3 | Sharing schema in a computable form | ✔ |
   
     We obviously want to prompt the scenario #3 above, and make the process easier with the schema tools from the Data Discovery Engine.

   - To better reuse schemas for interoperabilities.
